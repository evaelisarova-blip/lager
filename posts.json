    "text": "Yesterday — or maybe the day before — I saw an Instagram post by @ava_ark. It was a guide on how to be “un-Instagrammable.” On Instagram. She posted fragments of her daily life labeled “visually inconvenient.” The inconvenience, however, appeared well-lit. Carefully framed. Professionally underwhelming. She is young, beautiful, structurally advantaged. The aesthetic of imperfection suits her. I have been trying to practice kindness. I even googled “How to join Buddhism” last Monday. I am working on acceptance. And yet I cannot get rid of the sensation — almost physical — that we are witnessing a new mutation of performative social media culture. I am not speaking about the so-called “new sincerity” that migrated from metamodern cinema into online discourse. That movement at least wrestled with irony and belief. What I am observing now feels narrower, more platform-specific. It is the commodification of vulnerability in its most algorithm-friendly form. Educated young people — often economically cushioned, often culturally fluent — promote a bohemian mode of living that appears untouched by structural constraint. They aestheticize undone beds, naked skin, half-written journals, existential captions. They imply a life unburdened by financial anxiety, by administrative bureaucracy, by the dull grind of sustaining oneself. Curated vulnerability. "
